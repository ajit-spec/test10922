# MEAN Stack README

## Overview

The MEAN stack is a popular full-stack JavaScript solution for building dynamic web applications. It comprises four key technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented model.
- **Express.js**: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Getting Started

To set up a MEAN stack project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Download and install Node.js from the official website. npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js.

2. **Set up MongoDB**: Install MongoDB on your system or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.

3. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-mean-app
   cd my-mean-app
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Express.js**:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

5. **Set up Angular**:

   - Install the Angular CLI globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```
   - Create a new Angular project within your MEAN app directory:
     ```bash
     ng new client
     ```

6. **Connect MongoDB**: Use a MongoDB driver like `mongoose` to connect your Express server to MongoDB.
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```

## Development Workflow

- **Backend Development**: Use Express.js to create RESTful APIs that interact with MongoDB.
- **Frontend Development**: Develop the client-side application using Angular.
- **Integration**: Ensure that the Angular frontend can communicate with the Express backend through API calls.

## Deployment

Deploy your MEAN stack application to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform. Ensure that your MongoDB database is accessible from your deployment environment.
